- On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)

- Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
- Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.
